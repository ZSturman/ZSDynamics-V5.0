    "description": "This collection brings together a range of 3D models created during my early work in Blender. Each piece was built with a specific purpose, from simple objects intended for 3D printing to assets designed for animation and game environments. The collection is not centered on a single style or outcome, but on learning how digital form works across different contexts. Earlier models focus on basic structure, lighting, and scale, while later ones begin to account for motion, function, and narrative use. Taken together, the work documents a gradual shift from experimenting with tools to understanding how design decisions support real-world and virtual applications.",

    "story": "I started using Blender without a defined goal, beyond wanting to understand how 3D objects are constructed. The first models were simple and practical, often made so they could be printed or physically tested, which helped clarify how digital geometry translates into real space. As I grew more comfortable, I began creating characters and props for small animations and game scenes, where models needed to work within a larger system. Each project added a small lesson that stayed with me, whether about lighting, surface detail, or how form can suggest use or weight. Looking back, the collection reads as a timeline of that learning process, showing gradual improvement, experimentation, and a growing sense of control rather than a polished end result.  ",

I tend to work better when there’s a defined structure behind the idea. The coloring book came out of that mix of curiosity and restlessness. I liked the idea of laying out the history of everything, one page at a time, in a format people could spend time with. For a while, the project felt steady and satisfying—the research, the drawing, and the accumulation of pages. Over time, though, it started to feel more like an obligation than an exploration, so I stopped working on it. In hindsight, it served its role. It gave me a reason to draw again, to approach history in a different way, and to value the process even though the book itself remains unfinished.",

I started with the feeling of pressure—wanting to tell a story that felt big while being able to make it entirely on my own. Film was too expensive, too dependent on others, so animation became the path forward. After watching Breaking Bad and Rick and Morty, I became fascinated by how both could balance humor and despair within a single frame. The sad endings of Futurama and Rick and Morty stayed with me, the ones that lingered long after the joke was over. I wanted to build something that could carry that same weight, but through characters that felt painfully human despite their absurdity. Over time, Greenhorn grew into a study of how good intentions curdle under pressure and how easy it is to justify doing the wrong thing for the right reason. Each rewrite brought it closer to the story I saw in my head—the one about a kid who thinks he’s coasting through life but ends up steering straight into hell.",

The original idea came from childhood—stories I imagined on a swing set about futuristic heroes fighting impossible wars. Those fragments stayed with me until I decided to give them a world and a structure.\n\nWriting Timeline 7 taught me more about storytelling than anything else I’ve done. I didn’t know exactly how it would end, and in truth, it never quite did. I even started a sequel that I’ll probably never finish. Reading it later, I realized the story wanted to be something else—a graphic novel or maybe a video game—something more visual and alive than a book could hold. Still, finishing it mattered.

When I found out AirPods could actually pick up chewing through their motion data, I tested it and saw that the X-axis readings were consistent enough to use. From there, I built two iOS app versions that could record motion and video while someone eats.

    "description": "MediLedger is designed around a simple idea: most of what you need to do with your medication shouldn’t require opening an app. With interactive widgets, you can log a full or half dose, check how many pills you have left, see when your refill is coming up, and set up different widgets for different medications. The app handles both prescription and non-prescription meds, tracks strength and dosage, and keeps a full history of what you’ve taken. Everything syncs through SwiftData across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and it works offline when it needs to. You can customize what each widget shows, set up alerts for refills, and rely on automatic calculations to keep your supply accurate without any extra effort.",

I spent a lot of time figuring out how much a widget could handle: what buttons made sense, what info people would need at a glance, and how to keep things clean without stripping away control. The goal wasn’t to build a perfect app; it was to learn what happens when the widget becomes the main interaction surface. Eventually, I want this to connect with Trackables so all these small bits of daily data live in one place and start forming patterns that actually help people.

Around the same time, I started experimenting with QueueCards, which became an early version of what would later become my app Top Note.

    "description": "Top Note is a focused productivity app for people who tend to ignore reminders or feel weighed down by long to-do lists. It takes a simpler approach: one reminder, flashcard, or note at a time. You can complete it or skip it, and if you skip, it returns sooner through a spaced repetition system that keeps important things visible.\n\nThis design encourages accountability and steady progress. It helps build habits, strengthen memory, and keep personal ideas within reach—without the noise of endless lists.\n\nWhy it works\nTop Note combines two familiar ideas: single-task focus and spaced repetition. Together they keep your attention on what matters next, reinforcing memory and consistency over time.\n\nFeatures\n– One-at-a-time reminders that reduce distraction.\n– Skip and repeat so skipped items return sooner.\n– Spaced repetition flashcards for better recall.\n– Widget-first design that keeps the app close at hand.\n– Flexible note support for quotes, goals, or brief thoughts.\n– Simple setup inside the app; most use happens in the widget.\n\nBest for\n– People who often dismiss reminders.\n– Habit tracking and reinforcement.\n– Short study or review sessions.\n– Keeping a meaningful note visible through the day.\n\nTop Note makes productivity manageable by narrowing your focus. Instead of managing a list, you engage with one small task—and let time handle the rest.",
